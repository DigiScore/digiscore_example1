# digiscore_example1
Simple digiscore example using mic listener, random note generator and sound sampler with neoscore.

This is the base repo for the assignement in MUSI1017.

To start working with it you will need to:

- clone it into an IDE direct from GitHub (I recommend PyCharm community) (e.g. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/manage-projects-hosted-on-github.html )
- Build a VENV to store the external libraries (e.g. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html )
- Install all the external libraries listed in requirements.txt (e.g. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-dependencies.html )
- Save it to your own GitHub repository for version management, team collaboration and submission. (e.g. https://devmountain.com/blog/what-is-github-and-how-do-you-use-it/ )
